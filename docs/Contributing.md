# Contributing

Hey, thanks for taking the time to help me out with my site, much appreciated!

## Issues

If you find something wrong or needs attention please file an issue and follow
the instructions from the issue template.

## Code Changes

Before you submit a PR my way, please follow these guidelines:

* Fork the repo and create a feature branch
* Make your changes on that feature branch
* Do be sure to run the linting targets in the `Makefile` over any changes
  * Submissions that fail to lint cleanly will not be merged.
* Create pull requests against the master branch with a brief description.

And that's pretty much it, I'll review the PR and either merge or add feedback
as appropriate.

## Relevant Reading
