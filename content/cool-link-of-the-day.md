Ever wanted to sanity check your shell scripts?  Check out <https://www.shellcheck.net/>

Provides a basic REPL that checks your shell scripts for common issues.  Kinda neat, and admittedly I learned a thing or

There's also a command line version you can install that could potentially be used in things like a continuous
integration pipeline.
