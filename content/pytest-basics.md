summary: Learning some of the basics of Py.test
status: draft

So I'm fortunate enough to work for an employer who grants me access to
[Safari Books Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/). The other
day I was browsing the site to discover that they now have not only just
books, but also online courses/webinars on a variety of topics.

I stumbled across
[this one](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/getting-started-with-pythons-pytest/0636920166832/)
on Py.test which is a tool that is increasingly gaining traction in the
world of Python unit-testing, a world which I'm very much interested in.
As such, took the plunge and did the webinar, and thought I'd recap some
of the neat Py.test things that were new to me.  **Disclaimer**: with
the exception of a brief intro a colleague gave me at a previous job,
I've had no experience with Py.test so this is all going to be pretty
basic stuff.
