summary: Python is an awesome programming language. VS Code is an awesome editor. With their powers combined...

I'm a pretty big fan of the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org).  It's one
of those tools that strikes that wonderful balance between simplicity & power, where the
initial learning curve isn't super steep, but as you grow with it, it grows with you.

Last fall I found another tool which falls into this category:
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).  Initially I started with VS Code as
something to replace Sublime as a plain text editor, but before long I found myself using
VS Code for doing anything related to text editing, including working in Python.  As such,
now that I've learned a few things and feel like I'm fairly proficient with VS Code for
Python development, I thought I'd write up some "getting started" posts on how to get going
writing Python with VS Code.

Let's roll.
