Status: draft

So I was going to write a blog post outlining most of the stuff I did in getting this
site up off the ground, but then a colleague went ahead and did the same and
wrote up his journey. :)

So, in true CodependentCodr fashion, Imma going to stea...err borrow his content since I was largely the same steps.

Go here and here for all the deets on getting a static site set up with Pelican in AWS.
Ben does a great job too of walking through setting up a nice local dev pipeline with Docker
(mine's not quite the same, but similar, and I'm likely eventually going to do the same as him).
