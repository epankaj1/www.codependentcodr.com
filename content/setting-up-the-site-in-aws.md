So I was going to write a blog post outlining most of the stuff I did in getting this
site up off the ground, but then a colleague went ahead and did the same and
wrote up his journey. :)

So, in true CodependentCodr fashion, Imma going to stea...err borrow his content since
mine was largely the same steps (and he's better at AWS than I am). :p

Go [here](https://ben.gnoinski.ca/how-this-site-came-to-be.html) for all the deets on getting
a static site set up with Pelican in AWS. Ben does a great job too of walking through setting
up a nice local dev pipeline with Docker (mine's not quite the same, but similar, and I'm
likely eventually going to do the same as him).

Thanks Ben!
